# Cartilagineous tumors study data

Model data developed in weka for the classification of cartilagineous tumors using radiomics from CT images
The "Files" folder contains the trained model (usable in weka with an appropriate dataset) and a text file with the training-testing run information. In this file, the weights used by the final model are available as well as all predictions and predicted probabilities for each case both in the training (through cross-validation) and test sets. Corresponding confusion matrices and accuracy metrics are also presented.
